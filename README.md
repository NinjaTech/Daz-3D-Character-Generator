However! You do need to be registered and logged in to access the generator as the results can take some time to finish and there is a wait queue as my current rig can only do 1 at a time. So when it is finished it will send you an email and you can download the zip package from your account area. This is one reason registration is required. The other is to prevent spamming of the system.

What to Expect
The results will very a lot depending on the quality of the image submitted. AI’s are used to try and clean up the image as much as possible. The generator will create a Daz package for you to install into your Daz Library.

Included will be a morph slider for face and expression as well as:

* Head Morph
* Expression Morph (if your character had an expression or not in the original image)
* Displacement Remove and Add
* Character map applies for G8 and G8.1
* Eye color options
NOTE! Currently eyebrows are removed, I intend to add an option to allow eyebrows as part of the texture maps but that requires a second bake pass through Blender which is the most time exhausting part of the character generation so that is currently not an option. There is also in the works depending on funding fiber mesh generated eyebrows. For now you should use eyebrows from MR sets or other characters.

This will produce all the character texture maps and uses the Uber Shader settings. I am open to suggestions for different shader settings but it’s currently setup to the way I like. The overall skin tone and translucency layer is generated from a sampling off the forehead area. This probably needs some improvements.

This process takes a considerable amount of time running on the Frankenstein rig. Also only one can be processed at a time, so there is a waiting list to process. You will be notified with a link via email when the process is complete. Do not wait here for it be finished, this page will not inform you that it is finished.
